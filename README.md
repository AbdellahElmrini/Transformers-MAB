# Transformers-MAB

The goal of this project is to study whether a transformer can learn a particular multi-armed bandits strategy.

With minimal changes to the GPT architecture, we create an autoregressive model, which uses causal sequence modeling to choose the optimal action given the past actions and rewards.

We test our architecture on different bandit problems, and use sequences generated by multiple bandit strategies, including epsilon-greedy and UCB.
